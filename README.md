# This One Is Mine
> This is my issue. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Intentions
The intention of this repo was to create a super simple GitHub action that allows anyone to assign themselves to an issue by using the `/mine` command in a comment.

## Discovery
After starting work on this, we found [bdougie/take-action](https://github.com/bdougie/take-action) which was built 2 years before we opened this repo. We suggest you use that.

## Recommended accompaniments

Use in conjunction with our [Weeping Angel](https://github.com/GeekZoneHQ/weepingangel) action to ensure that only issues which are actively being worked on remain assigned.
